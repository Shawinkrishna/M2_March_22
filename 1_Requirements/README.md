 # OBJECTIVE : 
 
 

* To design and develop a prototype for an automated door sensor that can open and close automatically when it recognises infrared energy produced by the human body.



# INTRODUCTION :
 



Automatic door sensor as the name suggest , the sensor that detects when the door needs to open. When the sensor detects a cue , it then the signal to the door    operating mechanism. After receiving that signal , the mechanism opens the door. Most of the automatic door sensor PIR Sensor is used. The PIR sensor is used to open or close the door automatically which senses the infrared energy produced by the human body,the IR energy sensed by the PIR Sensor changes and activates the sensor tovopen the door or close the door automatically.
 
 




NOTE : My project is adout automatic door sensor in my project i implement the switch instead of using PIR Sensor,because in SimulIDE platform there is no available of the PIR Sensor. 
so i use switch incase of using the PIR Sensor.

# DESCRIPTION :




# ATMEGA328
 
 * Microchip's ATmega328 is an 8-bit, 28-pin AVR Microcontroller that uses RISC architecture and includes a 32KB flash-type programme memory.
 * The Atmega328 microcontroller is found in the Arduino UNO, Arduino Pro Mini, and Arduino Nano boards.
 * It can function at voltages ranging from 3.3 to 5.5 volts, but we usually choose 5 volts as a standard.
 * Cost-effectiveness, low power consumption, programming lock for security, and true timer counter with independent oscillator are only a few of its outstanding      qualities.
 * It's most commonly found in Embedded Systems. Take a look at these Real-Life Embedded System Examples; we can design all of them with this Microcontroller.






# VOLTMETER
 
 * Voltmeter which is also known as voltage meter is an instrument that measures the voltage or potential difference among two points of an electronic or electrical circuit. Usually, the voltmeter is used for Alternating Current (AC) circuits or Direct Current (DC) circuits.





# LED - LIGHT EMITTING DIODE


* LED stands for light emitting diode. LED lighting products produce light up to 90% more efficiently than incandescent light bulbs. How do they work. An electrical current passes through a microchip, which illuminates the tiny light sources we call LEDs and the result is visible light.

* The high efficiency and directional nature of LEDs makes them ideal for many industrial uses. LEDs are increasingly common in street lights, parking garage lighting, walkway and other outdoor area lighting, refrigerated case lighting, modular lighting, and task lighting.




# SWITCH 
 
 
* switch is a device used to make or break a connection in a circuit so you an turn power on and off to something, or a change in attitude or policy. An example of a switch is the switch on the wall you use to turn your light on and off.

*  switch is an electrical component that can disconnect or connect the conducting path in an electrical circuit, interrupting the electric current or diverting it from one conductor to another.



# RESISTOR 


* A resistor controls the flow of the electrical current within a circuit. Resistors are made from materials like copper or carbon, which make it difficult for the electrical charges to flow through a circuit.

* A device that has electrical resistance and that is used in an electric circuit for protection, operation, or current control.


# BUZZER 

* The buzzer is a sounding device that can convert audio signals into sound signals. It is usually powered by DC voltage.
* Buzzer is a "Simple Actuator".


# FIXED VOLT 

* A fixed voltage regulator produces a fixed DC output voltage, which is either positive or negative. In other words, some fixed voltage regulators produce positive fixed DC voltage values, while others produce negative fixed DC voltage values.



# WORKING PRINCIPLE :

After wiring and connecting all of the devices and connecting them to the switch,check all of the necessary setups to see if anything is missing. Following the connection setup, In the next step is to submit/upload the code to the microcontroller and power up the circuit. After upload the code,press the simulatation button once the system is turns ON,press the fixed volt to turn on.when the switch is open the led starts blinking which denotes the door is opened and when the switch is closed the buzzer turns on and make a sound which denotes the door is closed.
