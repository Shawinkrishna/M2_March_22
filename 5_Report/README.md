# INTRODUCTION :
 
 Automatic door sensor as the name suggest , the sensor that detects when the door needs to open. When the sensor detects a cue , it then the signal to the door    operating mechanism. After receiving that signal , the mechanism opens the door. Most of the automatic door sensor PIR Sensor is used. The PIR sensor is used to open or close the door automatically which senses the infrared energy produced by the human body,the IR energy sensed by the PIR Sensor changes and activates the sensor tovopen the door or close the door automatically.
 
 
NOTE : My project is adout automatic door sensor in my project i implement the switch instead of using PIR Sensor,because in SimulIDE platform there is no available of the PIR Sensor. 
so i use switch incase of using the PIR Sensor. 
 
 
 
 
 # OBJECTIVE : 
 
 
 * To design and develop a prototype for an automated door sensor that can open and close automatically when it recognises infrared energy produced by the human body.

 
 
 
 
 # COMPONENTS :
 
 
 * ATMEGA328
 * VOLTMETER
 * LED
 * SWITCH
 * RESISTOR
 * BUZZER
 * FIXED VOLT








# WORKING PRINCIPLE :

After wiring and connecting all of the devices and connecting them to the switch,check all of the necessary setups to see if anything is missing. Following the connection setup, In the next step is to submit/upload the code to the microcontroller and power up the circuit. After upload the code,press the simulatation button once the system is turns ON,press the fixed volt to turn on.when the switch is open the led starts blinking which denotes the door is opened and when the switch is closed the buzzer turns on and make a sound which denotes the door is closed.











# IN ACTION



# OFF MODE :

# ON MODE :

   * Upload the code to the microcontroller and power up the circuit.
   * After upload the code , press the power circuit button in SimulIDE software.
   * once the system is turns ON , press the fixed volt to turn ON . when the switch is open the led starts blinking which indicates that the door is opened.
   * I used the switch instead of using PIR Sensor.

 # BUZZER ON MODE :

 * When the switch is closed the led  turn OFF and buzzer gets turns ON and indicates that the door is closed.
 * I used the switch instead of using PIR Sensor.
